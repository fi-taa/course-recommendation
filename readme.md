# Course Recommendation System

This project implements a content-based recommendation system for online courses. The recommendation is based on user input for 'course_provided_by', 'learning_product_type', and 'course_difficulty'. The system uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity to identify courses that are most similar to the user's preferences.
